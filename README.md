"These project file presents a comprehensive econometric analysis conducted using EViews. The analysis encompassed various techniques, including linear and multiple regressions, goodness-of-fit assessments,chow test , hypothesis analysis , multicollinearity detection via auxiliary regression and correlation matrix, heteroskedasticity identification using tests such as Breusch-Pagan, White, and Glejser, autocorrelation analysis through D statistics and BG LM test, and specification error detection using the Ramsey RESET test. The report succinctly outlines the steps taken, providing interpretations of the findings at each stage. These interpretations shed light on the model's explanatory power, the presence of multicollinearity and heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation issues, and potential specification errors. The insights gleaned from these analyses contribute to a deeper understanding of the dataset and its implications for the research question at hand."
